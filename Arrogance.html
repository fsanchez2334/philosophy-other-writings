    <center><h1>Arrogance/Narcissism</h1></center>
<p>
    What is there to see in a man with such arrogance? Perfection, I think not. Often we are told that that our potential can be let shine until eternity. However, there are those who often misinterpret the true meaning of that saying. These people become drunk with success and competition. Though this may not be bad at its entirety, there are limits to sustain ourselves. No one is perfect and very often, arrogant people tend to live over appreciated in their own minds, compared to the reputation they uphold in the real world. The narcissist usually restitutes for the lack of insight in reality and puts on a mask in order to act. However, there are those who know the true meaning of showing potential. These people know they are of higher intellect, but do not brag or become pretentious people. These people are genuine humans who understand the necessity of mistakes and the opportunity to rectify. We also see in these humans the genuine feeling of helping others with their intellects. Therefore, those with intellectual superiority realize that never committing a mistake is equal to never living a nature of life.

    One must also stipulate the concept that arrogance does come at a high price. Sure, you are presented with the road that offers an escapade towards a greater future. Consequently, it is human nature to boastfully share our accomplishments with the world. From such an objective standpoint, this can be true and perfectly fine; hence, this behavior resembles to that of an alpha male in the jungle, desperate to claim a land as their own territory. However, if one looks at society as a populace built upon by humans than animals, then it is my vision that arrogance is one to be left to the animals. When one brags, whether it be about riches or intellect, what is the real gain from all that boasting? The answer may lie on a spectrum of vanity, that encompasses people that are filled with deceit and lies. It should be noted that this notion of human behavior was looked upon by the Greeks as something that would lead to disaster or tragedy, for the epic of Odysseus seems to be support such statement. Nevertheless, in the world that we live in today, it is quite disheartening to see how status or self-image is more valuable than the dignity of one’s self. It would be the equivalent of a tree acknowledging the fruition that the branches hold, without acknowledging the roots that give it strength. Towards the end, the tree, as humans, realize that the branches eventually go away, along with the leaves. The foundation that remains for the duration of a tree’s lifetime will always be the roots.

    One might also put forth the argument that without arrogance, man simply has a higher chance of being trampled over. In a capitalistic society, this can be quite accurate, for people, to some extent, do actually earn what they take. However, I offer the thought: does this indefinitely exclude the concept of humble pride? Now, let me also clarify that, as the author, I am not advocating for a Marxist, socialist, or any other form of government. In fact, no advocacy for a specific government would be needed if men were angels, as James Madison rightfully stated. Nevertheless, the concept of humble pride is forgotten in this world, and with that, the vision of other human beings as being human. As humans, it is in our nature to be our best because we are told that we are one star in the sky, rightfully deserving of what the world has to offer. In doing so, people tend to forget that the galaxy is shared with other stars who have heard the same teaching or instruction. What causes great pity is that the stars are proof that a union of people can partake in a natural environment with some unity, yet we as humans with intelligence can’t really synthesize that. Would it hurt one day to be a star, not the one we think we are, not the one we admire, but the one that we will one day become?

    Last but not least, the question can later arise: Well, what do you do with those who are arrogant by nature and just won’t respect the nature of being humble? Then I will present you this question: To what extent can one go to with logical reasoning to lower the ego of such narcissistic individual? The answer is that you, as a person, can only do so much. Perhaps the individual that is so consumed with great vanity is too blind by the darkness that clouds their wonderful and unexplored soul. On the other hand, you might come across the person who was born into a privileged condition that their mindset just can’t synthesize the validity of your statements; it is only until they hear it from someone of “equal or high social status”. . But, in this scenario, the phrase of “nature always winning” is definitely applicable. Nature being the most powerful and cryptic puzzle that we know as life. As this never-ending puzzle gets solved throughout the years, the individuals will come to realize the road that they have entered or escaped. No arrogant individual can live with the blasphemous ideology that death can be bought or evaded; even the less poetic populace knows that. Life, undoubtedly, is the cruel teacher that rarely gives out an A to all individuals; that simply isn’t the case. On the contrary, it will undoubtedly give major F’s, especially to the narcissist who mistakes this for an A. In the end, experiences teach the individual that they had the chance to change their failures or that, lamentably, they are one.

    Narcissism mixed with vanity under the realm of a false identity is a primitive mistake to be enthralled. Inevitably, all human beings will go through a period of subconsciously posing to be superior than other. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that even such arrogant people can realize that humility, though arguably may be the slowest to reap crops the fastest, it will certainly create an abundance that surpasses those produced by arrogance. In the end, if a dying, arrogant creature cares more about the reflection of itself in the ocean than about the boat sailing away, then that, my friends, is a pitiful death indeed.

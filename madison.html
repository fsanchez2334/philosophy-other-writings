<center><h1>James Madison: A Promoter of Liberty</h1></center>
<p>
     After the American Revolution, the establishment of a just government for the American people became a pivotal objective. During the process, the concept of liberty was defined differently among the founding fathers and the political parties at the time: Federalists and Democratic Republicans. While there were those that believed that the principles of liberty be restricted, there were those that advocated for the people to be entitled and protected by the ideals of freedom and liberty. James Madison falls under the category of being an avid supporter of liberty for the people. Although his presidency may not have fully reflected this ideal, he was a strong proponent for the individual rights of the people, connected the concept of liberty to the government, and helped the people acquire property.

    During the infancy stage of the nation, many delegates of Congress realized that the United States was struggling to face their struggles in uniform manner. Most importantly, James Madison became concerned at the possibility of state legislatures intervening with the rights of the people, especially when it came to both property and religion. Though Madison was not in favor of a the implementation of the Bill of Rights, for he deemed it as an unnecessary act (Gonzales 32), he would then change his position, in order to come to a compromise with the Virginian delegates at the state’s ratifying convention. Moreover, including the Bill of Rights was meant to mitigate the growing concerns that the Americans had as the power of government was becoming well defined. This message is illustrated in Madison’s statement in the First Congress when he states “Citizens who remained actively opposed to the new government . . . could create many problems . . . if they believed their concerns about a bill of rights were not taken seriously” (Gonzales 66). In other words, James Madison highlights the central prospect that takes root of the opposition of a strong government; as a result, by including the Bill of Rights, it would ensure the people a strong level of protection, such that the government would not infringe upon the rights of American citizens. This correlates with a fundamental principle of Madison, a Democratic Republican, as Richard Labunski mentions that James Madison saw a relationship between the consent of the people and the government of the nation. This further reinforces the identity of James Madison being a promoter of liberty because it corresponds to his ideals of being a Democratic Republican, a person who strongly fought for a limited government and for power to be granted to the people as whole, as opposed to just the elite and wealthy. As a result, his position of coming to a compromise of including a Bill of Rights enabled him to gain the great support for the ratification of the Constitution. As the years progressed, the Bill of Rights would aid in the problems that would follow, some of which pitted the American people with political affairs.

    James Madison demonstrated being an advocate for the civil rights of the people, for he was a strong proponent when it came to religious liberty. As a young delegate, Madison upheld a fundamental principle that the people were entitled to have a right to practice their religion freely and with no fear of judgment. This notion is depicted in Madison’s excerpt in the Virginia Declaration of Rights where he states “ all men are entitled to the full and free exercise of it according to the dictates of conscience; and therefore no man or class of men ought on account of religion to be invested with particular emoluments or privileges, nor subjected to any penalties or disabilities” (Smith 44). In the context of government, Madison considers it essential that the government does not have the right to interfere or dictate what a person decides to believe in, or subjugate them to an atmosphere of prejudice of penalty. Nevertheless, James Madison was strongly against a religion or a group of believers to be given special privilege or treatment. In December 1784, the “Bill establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion” was passed, and this required the people to support the Christian religion by paying a moderate tax to churches of a christian denomination, or offer some form of worship (Smith 55). Even though Madison’s earlier opposition was rendered weak, it didn’t impede him from drafting a petition titled “Memorial and Remonstrance”, in which he disavowed the actions that the bill called for, as well as fortifying an argument for equal treatment of different religions. For instance, in his petition he claims “We maintain therefore that, in matters of religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of civil society, and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance..Whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace... we cannot deny an equal freedom to those whose minds have not yet yielded to the evidence which has convinced us” (Smith 64). In other words, in this statement, Madison reiterates the idea that a person is entitled to their own religious beliefs, and he argues that it would be hypocritical for the people to deprive religious freedom from those who may think or believe differently, as this behavior goes against the prime foundations of the country. This fight for religious liberty portrays Madison as a promoter of liberty because he argued for the right of all individuals to believe in a faith of their choice, without the interference of the government or other people. Therefore, though James Madison was an Episcopalian, he faced the endeavor of ensuring an equal amount of respect for all religions.

    In the way that James Madison was supportive of religious liberty, he was equally supportive of having the freedom to express one’s thoughts and ideas, even if it meant critiquing the government. In 1794, the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed under the presidency of John Adams, which restricted foreigners and people who conspired against the regulations of the government of the United States (Boyd 70), which elicited great disapprobation from Madison. In accordance to the Alien Acts, he believed that there was no division of governmental power if the President was left to decide who was a national danger without consulting a judicial power (Boyd 73). On the other hand, Madison believed that the Sedition Acts infringed upon the right of the people: to be able to voice their opinions and insights, and communicate their concerns and values as a people. In a way, James Madison acknowledged the fundamental realization of some of the founding fathers, which is that the freedom is expression is the prime roots of all the other succeeding rights; if the right of freely expressing one’s thoughts is suppressed, then all the other rights become endangered. This opposition to the suppression of free speech, fortifies the point of James Madison being a promoter of liberty because it shows that he sees the inherent value of the people having the right to voice their concerns, demonstrating that he abides by the foundations that the nation was built on.

    Aside from being a strong advocate for civil liberties, James Madison exhibits his ideals of liberty through his essays in The Federalist Papers by connecting the notion of liberty with the government. For instance, in the tenth essay of The Federalist Papers, Madison calls for the preservation of liberty, even if it serves as an impulse to further the cause of factions, which Madison defines as “a number of citizens...who are united and actuated by some impulse of passion..adverse to the rights of to the rights of other citizens”(Madison 72). In this essay, Madison states “Liberty is to faction what air is to fire..it could not be a less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life...which is essential to animal life” (Madison 73). In this excerpt, Madison argues that resolving the problem of existing factions does not consist of depriving them of liberty, for this notion would have to apply to other circumstances. Equally, as Madison argues, these people can’t be given “the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests” (Madison 73), because the people are always prone to set forth different ideas and values in order to pursuit their own interests, and consequently, such actions will be present in the nation. As a result, Madison argues, it is the responsibility of the government presented in the Constitution to mitigate the damage that factions cause, and in return, secure the liberties of American citizens (Madison 73). In this essay, while arguing for the government that is set forth by the Constitution, Madison portrays his alignment with liberty because even in the face of problems, he recognizes that liberty is a principle that is to be extended throughout the different sectors of society, and at the same time, he argues that it is possible for a government to exist in order to ensure that not one liberty of a group tramples over the liberty of another.
</p>
<p>
     Madison is able to make a further connection between liberty and government in his essay regarding the structure of government and its checks and balances. In this essay, Madison emphasizes the importance of having a government that will make sure that no branch becomes more powerful than the others, as he states “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition...It may be a reflection on human nature that such devices must be necessary to control the abuses of government”(Madison 319). In a greater spectrum, Madison makes note that if there are no limitations that will prevent the powers of the branches of government, then it is improbable that the government will uphold the protection of the liberties of Americans. However, Madison makes note that the authority of the government rests upon society, which is beneficial because “society itself will be broken into so many parts, interests, and classes of citizens” (Madison 321). In other words, this suits the nation because if there is diversity of groups within society, then there is little possibility of a “majority group” to take over the ideologies of those from a minority group (Madison 321). Therefore, under these circumstances, liberty is being promoted by Madison because not only does he place power in the people in relation to the government, but liberty is placed among the different levels of society because everyone is entitled to securely revel in their constitutional rights, and no major faction takes ahold to oppress the liberties of the underrepresented.

    Last but not least, Madison can be considered as an advocate for liberty, for he supported the people in acquiring land during the Louisiana Purchase. During Jefferson’s presidency, James Madison served as secretary of state, and was responsible for the handling the diplomatic affairs in attempting to purchase the city of New Orleans for ten million dollars, in order to protect the interest of America’s westward expansion, for Napoleon had the intention in establishing a formidable empire in the Caribbean and in the Gulf of Mexico (Ketcham). As a result, Madison’s approval of buying the Louisiana territory is a proof of him supporting liberty, for his actions was an example of him upholding a fundamental principle of Jeffersonian Democracy: Giving power to the people in the form of land acquisition. Under Jefferson’s presidency, owning land would contribute to the people being able to cultivate and produce their own profit; therefore, Madison’s participation in the Louisiana Purchase upheld this principle. 
</p>

    Though Madison’s contributions to promoting liberty had a great impact in the development of the nation, some people may point out significant issues that portray the contrary. First of all, a possible argument that can be made about James Madison is that he did not directly deal with the issue of slavery. However, one must consider the great political opposition at the time, and the ongoing sense of sectionalism within the country. Moreover, this was a difficult topic for a single delegate to take charge, and it was unlikely for a person or compromise to resolve the problem. For instance, though the Missouri Compromise was able to ease the situation, the division of slavery would soon evolve into Civil War; therefore, even if Madison were to effect change, it is likely that it would make a great difference. Another argument that could be derived against Madison would be his support for the Federalist ideal of a strong government, as opposed to weak central government that favored the people more. Nevertheless, one should take into account the disarray that the nation faced while having the Articles of Confederation. Under the Articles, there was no executive or judicial branch, and the government could not tax the states, nor states would agree to pay them, which placed economic pressure on the nation. Due to these crucial dilemmas, it would explain the need to develop a strong government, as a way to prevent such problems to occur again. Nevertheless, Madison’s decision to later enforce a strong government is not necessarily him restricting liberty because he was influential in his works, such as the Bill of Rights and essays in The Federalist Papers, in order to ensure that such government would protect the liberties of the people. Therefore, despite of Madison’s controversial actions, his contributions to protect liberty should not go unnoticed.

    James Madison was a founding father that largely promoted the liberty of the American people. He protected their inalienable rights, advocated for the government to protect their liberties, and helped Americans acquire land. Madison’s foundations of protecting liberty often becomes undermined today, for many people of different faiths, specifically Muslims, can not enjoy the religious liberty that Madison fought for. As opposed to having all faiths be included in “We the People”, the country today excludes a religion from being entitled the principles of this nation.

# Philosophy and Other Writings
# By: Marquis Kenway

<p> Hello. Welcome to my own website, in which I willingly share my own perspectives on the modern world, and its possible appliance in anyone's future. As with any philosophy, there is not a wrong or right answer, rather a culmination of ideas that influence the logic of any given indivdual. In this website, contrary to the title, for lack of a better name, is not entirely philosphical, but may include short stories, poems etc. All I ask is that one be respectful and mindful; nevertheless, enjoy!
